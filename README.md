# General Assembly Project 1

## Description

This was the first project assignment that I was given on the Software Engineering Immersive course that I took at General Assembly. It took place immediately after our first three weeks, which looked at HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project was intended for us to solidify and put into practice everything that we had learnt up to that point. For the project I chose to make a version of the game frogger, in which you played a pair of boots that had to get across a bog. The theme of the game is an inside joke amongst my friends, with whom I wanted to play the game once it was finished.

## Code installation

Firstly download the code onto your local machine. After you have done that there are various ways you can run this project locally.

During development I used the Live Server extension on VSCode. You can download it from the extensions page, right click on the index.html file and then click ‘Open with Live Server’. The game will then open in your browser. 

Alternatively you can open the project in your file browser and double click on the index.html file, which will do the same thing.

## Timeframe and Working Team

This was a solo project, and we were given a week to complete it.

## Technologies used

The project was built exclusively using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Brief

Our brief for this project was to make a web browser game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We were given a choice of games including, frogger, snake, space invaders, connect 4 and others. I chose to make frogger because I loved to play it when I was younger and I had a good idea in my head from the off of what I wanted to do with it.

## Planning

The first step I took for this project was to create a wireframe of Excalidraw that also included some pseudocode.

I had a lot of ideas for features that I wanted to implement into the game so I set out on prioritising the order in which I would go through them, starting with my MVP and ending with features that I felt were less important or central to the game. I also began to think through some of the problems that I might come across when building the project, such as how to calculate the location of objects, space them, and end the game when they came into collision with the player. In looking at the projects of previous students who had also done frogger, I was really impressed by some of the features and styles implemented, but I found with a lot of them that playing the actual game didn’t feel quite right. I decided then that for my project I wanted to prioritise making sure the gameplay worked, and this meant making key aspects of the game easily modifiable, so that once all aspects of the game were implemented I could easily tweak them to improve how the game played.
